# Website-Stylingguide-Project

This was the second challenge project for the Codecademy Fullstack Engineer Career-path.
The scope of this project was to use the up until then learned HTML & CSS skills and build a website styleguide page.

## Here is the original project scope from the Codecademy-website:

### Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System

#### Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building your own basic design system for a website. In essence, you’ll be building a website to help you build MORE websites in the future! On your site, you’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.
